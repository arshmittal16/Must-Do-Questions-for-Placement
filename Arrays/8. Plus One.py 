# Given a non-negative number represented as a list of digits, add 1 to the number (increment the number represented by the digits). The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is first element of array. 

# Your Task:
# You don't need to read input or print anything. You only need to complete the function increment() that takes an integer N, and an array arr of size N as input and returns a list of integers denoting the new number which we get after adding one to the number denoted by the array arr.


# Expected Time Complexity:  O(N)
# Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
