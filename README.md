# Must-Do-Questions-for-Placement
Starting January 3, I'll be following 100 Days of Code in which I'll solve 2-5 problem statements everyday for 100 days. Question Bank I'm following is GeeksForGeeks' Must Do Questions for Interview <br>
My Primary Coding Language is Python. However, for problems which are too easy to write in Python, I'll use C++

Feel free to use :)
